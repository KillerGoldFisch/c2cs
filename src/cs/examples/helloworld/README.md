# README

This folder contains 3 minimal C# example projects named "helloworld". Build and run them in the following order to
demonstrate the minimal usage of `c2cs`.

1. `helloworld-bindgen`: The C# app that builds the C library and generates the C# bindings.
2. `helloworld-app`: The C# application that uses the built C library and generated C# bindings at runtime.
