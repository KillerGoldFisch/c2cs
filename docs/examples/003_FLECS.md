# Flecs

This is an example of how to build the shared library, generate the C# bindings, and use from C#: https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs

1. Run the C# project [`flecs-c`](/src/dotnet/examples/flecs/flecs-c/Program.cs) to build the shared library and generate the bindings. This project will have an example of how to use C2CS.
2. Run any of the C# projects named [`flecs-XX_Y`](/src/dotnet/examples/flecs).

If you just want the bindings, you can see [`flecs.cs`](/src/dotnet/examples/flecs/flecs-cs/flecs.cs).
