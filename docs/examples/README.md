Here you will find a catalog of C libraries that have working examples to demonstrate how to use `C2CS`.

See https://github.com/lithiumtoast/c2cs-example-helloworld for a minimal example of using `C2CS` to create a hello world program seperate from the `C2CS` repository.

## [0: Hello world](./000_HELLOWORLD.md)

Hello world example of calling a C function from C#. This is meant to be minimalistic to demonstrate the minimum required things to get this working.

## [1: libclang](./001_LIBCLANG.md)
